# Mock data showing how attribute values vary across slices
# This simulates what would be in actual data, showing attachment patterns

slices:
  - oid: WC.GLUCOSE.BASELINE
    dimensions:
      LBTEST: Glucose
      VISITNUM: 1
    attributes:
      STUDYID: STUDY001        # Constant across all slices
      LBCAT: CHEMISTRY         # Varies by LBTEST (Glucose/Sodium=CHEMISTRY, Platelet=HEMATOLOGY)
      LBSTRESU: mg/dL          # Varies by LBTEST
      VISIT: Baseline          # Varies by VISITNUM
  
  - oid: WC.GLUCOSE.WEEK4
    dimensions:
      LBTEST: Glucose
      VISITNUM: 2
    attributes:
      STUDYID: STUDY001        # Same everywhere
      LBCAT: CHEMISTRY         # Same as other Glucose (varies by LBTEST)
      LBSTRESU: mg/dL          # Same as other Glucose (varies by LBTEST)
      VISIT: Week 4            # Different from Baseline (varies by VISITNUM)
  
  - oid: WC.SODIUM.BASELINE
    dimensions:
      LBTEST: Sodium
      VISITNUM: 1
    attributes:
      STUDYID: STUDY001        # Same everywhere
      LBCAT: CHEMISTRY         # Same as Glucose (varies by LBTEST)
      LBSTRESU: mmol/L         # Different from Glucose (varies by LBTEST)
      VISIT: Baseline          # Same as other Baseline (varies by VISITNUM)
  
  - oid: WC.PLATELET.BASELINE
    dimensions:
      LBTEST: Platelet
      VISITNUM: 1
    attributes:
      STUDYID: STUDY001        # Same everywhere
      LBCAT: HEMATOLOGY        # Different from Chemistry tests (varies by LBTEST)
      LBSTRESU: 10^9/L         # Different from other tests (varies by LBTEST)
      VISIT: Baseline          # Same as other Baseline (varies by VISITNUM)

# Expected inference results:
# STUDYID: Dataset-level (constant everywhere)
# LBCAT: Dimension-level, attached to LBTEST
# LBSTRESU: Dimension-level, attached to LBTEST
# VISIT: Dimension-level, attached to VISITNUM
